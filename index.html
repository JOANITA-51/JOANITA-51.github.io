            I participated in a Hackathon organised by  Women In Technology  Uganda (WITU). My group is working on a project whose goal is to 
            address the sanitation in Kampala. This was an eye opener on how  to solve the problems in the society and the procedures involved in starting up  a business.

                  <p>Joanita is an IT genius. I have watched her work on numerous projects which all turn out really 
                      well because of the time and effort she puts in. When she is really into a particular IT related project,
                       she literally works day and night to make it a success. Being in the same class with her has made me draw
                        motivation from her in the field of IT and I can strongly say Anita is the best.</p>

                  <p>I met Miss Nakityo Joanita a few months ago at Ablestate Creatives Ltd.
                       Joanita is among the six out of 30 applicants who were awarded a scholarship in software development skills at Ablestate. 
                       I am her coach. I have found her to be committed, vibrant, punctual, and a person with a positive attitude. 
                      I would highly commend her for any opportunity.</p>

                   Joanita is hardworking, teamwork-oriented, friendly and yet a multi-tasker.
                    We worked together during a hackathon where we were tasked to find a problem and find solutions to it.
                    I realized that Joanita is so creative and has passion for software development most especially finding solutions to prevailing problems.
                     I personally sometimes get motivation from her.
                    I greatly believe that once added to your team, she will be an asset to your organization.

                      Even before we graduated she already had a certificate from the University of Michigan.She is the most reliable hardworking girl I know and you can trust her to get the job done.
                      i have never seen one more in love with IT like her not only IT but software world in general desiring to use her skills to create change in it.She is amazing as an engineer but also as a friend. 
                      I've seen her spend days seated at her desk without eating yet she didn't complain or claim to be hungry or tired. She has the best energy in the room.Her capacity and capability is to die for.
                       She is her unique geek self .</p>
